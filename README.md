# Interactiv card app (using Vue.js 2) 

This app will allow you to edit and send a virtual card for one of your relatives. Test it !
For running the app, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) npm version 3+ and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Use those commands to generate node_modules & co (using vue-cli).
```
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init webpack-simple name-of-the-app
$ cd name-of-the-app
$ npm install
$ npm run dev

```

if there is an issue with ```npm run dev```, try this command : 
```
$ npm install webpack-dev-server@2.9.7 --save-dev
$ npm run dev
```

When your files and folders are created, you can replace what is inside and src/ by what is on this github.
